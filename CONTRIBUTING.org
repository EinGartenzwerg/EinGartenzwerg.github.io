The goal of this project lies in the creation of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open Educational Resources (OER)]]
for an introductory course on computer science (IntroCS).
Currently, most educational resources are HTML presentations that can be
viewed in any web browser.  You do not need to know HTML to contribute
to or adopt these resources as they a written in a simple markup
language called [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], from which HTML
presentations based on the presentation framework
[[https://revealjs.com/][reveal.js]] are generated automatically with
the FLOSS software bundle
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/emacs-reveal][emacs-reveal]] by Jens Lechtenbörger.

Your contributions to presentations and its underlying software are
very welcome!  So if you are an instructor or student working with
these OER, please share your thoughts and improvements.

So far, OER for IntroCS are generated (and branded) exclusively for use at
the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany, but adoption at other places and
in other contexts would be simple if someone expressed interest in
collaboration.  Towards that end, contents would need to be separated
from my class-specific bits and pieces, for which a companion project
on basics of Distributed Systems (DS) by Jens Lechtenbörger provides an example: Jens Lechtenbörger maintains
“pure”, unbranded contents in the project
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/cs/distributed-systems][oer/cs/distributed-systems]],
while the project [[https://gitlab.com/oer/oer-courses/cacs][oer/oer-courses/cacs]]
demonstrates the use of those contents in a specific class context
(for a course on Communication and Collaboration Systems [CACS]).

If you want to contribute, please open an issue, propose changes, or
submit merge/pull requests as explained for these
[[https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/EinGartenzwerg.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][presentations on GitHub]].

In particular, if you find current presentations lacking in terms of visualizations, please help to improve the situation!
