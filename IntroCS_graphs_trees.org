** History of graph theory - Euler (1736): The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg
Devise a walk through the city that would cross each of those bridges once and only once.
By specifying the logical task unambiguously, solutions do not involve
- reaching an island or mainland bank other than via one of the bridges
- accessing any bridge without crossing to its other end

** Definition of Graphs
*** Directed Graphs
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
Definition: $G = (V,E)$ where:
#+END_EXPORT
- *V* is the set of all *vertices in a graph*
	- #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex $v\inV$ #+END_EXPORT is one vertex of a graph
	- for each vertex we dreaw one node
- *E* is the set of all *edges in a graph
	- #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex $e\inE$ #+END_EXPORT is one edge of a graph
	- #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex $e = (u,v)$ #+END_EXPORT, e is a relation between two vertices
		- u is the start vertex
		- v is the end/destination vertex
	- For each edge, we draw an arrow from the start to the end node
