## Description

IntroCS is an introductory course for computer science. The course is offered by the institute for inforamtion systems at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany and is especcialy tailored for the master degree program in International Information Systems, for students who have little or no background in computer science. The course makes use of contents of the chair of digital industrial service systems (FAU), CS50 (Harvard) and 6.000 (MIT).

Among this course’s objectives is to supply students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline of computer science. We will do so using programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be stressed that this is not a “programming course”; rather, this course should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By year’s end, students will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. Students will be able to speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers, and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.

## Expectations

Students are expected to submit all problems and to actively take part in the lectures and tutorial!

## Books

No books are required for this course. However, students may want to supplement their preparation for or review of some lectures with self-assigned readings relevant to those lectures' content from either of the books below.

## Recommended Order

We present below a recommended ordering of the curriculum and a suggested timetable. These recommendations are based on a 36-week long school year, where students are available for 180 classroom minutes. However, student experience can vary widely; these recommendations are designed to capture an "average" class.

1. Understanding Technology (3 weeks)
2. Chapter 0 (2 weeks)
3. Performance Task 1: Explore (2 weeks)
4. Chapter 1 (4 weeks)
5. Chapter 2 (3 weeks)
6. Chapter 3 (4 weeks)
7. Chapter 4 (2 weeks)
8. Data Science (1 week)
9. Chapter 5 (3 weeks)
10. Chapter 6 (3 weeks)
11. Chapter 7 (3 weeks)
12. Chapter 8 (2 weeks)
13. Performance Task 2: Create (3 weeks)
12. Impact of Computing (1 week)

## Academic Honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.
The essence of all work that students submit to this course must be their own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted except to the extent that students may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing thier work for them. Generally speaking, when asking for help, students may show their code to others, but they may not view their peers', so long as they respect this policy's other constraints.
Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.
