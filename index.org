* What is this?
This page collects
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][OER]]
presentations (HTML slides with embedded audio and PDF variants, available under
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_license][free]] and open
[[https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/][Creative Commons licenses]]
in Section [[#presentations]], preceded by usage hints in
Section [[#hints]])
for an indtroductory course on computer science as part of the module
[[https://www.is.rw.fau.de/lehre/veranstaltungen/intro-to-cs/][Introduction to Computer Science]]
for first semester students in the Master degree program in
[[http://iis.fau.de/][International Information Systems]]
at the [[https://www.fau.de/][Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany]].
Some background concerning the origin of this project and the adopted
teaching and learning strategy is explained in its [[https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/EinGartenzwerg.github.io/blob/master/README.md][README]].

If you are teaching or learning computer science, feel free to
use, share, and adapt my presentations.  As usual for projects on GitHub/GitLab,
you can open [[https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue][issues]]
to report bugs or suggest improvements, ideally
with [[https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request][pull requests]].
The document
[[https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/EinGartenzwerg.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][CONTRIBUTING]]
contains some pointers for contributors.

Students in Münster have taken courses on programming in Java, data
structures and algorithms, and data modeling before taking “Computer
Structures and Operating Systems.”  As *prerequisite* for Operating
Systems, students should
- be able to write, compile, and execute small /Java/ programs,
- be able to use basic /data structures/ (stack, queue, tree) and
  /algorithms/ (in particular, hashing);
- also, being able to explain the database /transaction concept/ and
  /update anomalies/ will ease understanding of presentations on
  mutual exclusion.

*Learning objectives*: After taking this course, students will be able
- to discuss major architectures and components of modern OSs; to
  explain and contrast processes and threads and their roles for OSs
  and applications,
- to explain OS data structures, algorithms, and management techniques,
- to analyze programming challenges arising from concurrency
  and to apply appropriate techniques addressing these challenges,
- to discuss the notion of IT security and to apply security
  mechanisms provided by the operating system in support of
  secure IT systems.
