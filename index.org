* Context
The [[https://gitlab.com/oer][group ~oer~ at GitLab]] collects
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][Open
Educational Resources (OER)]].
In a nutshell, educational resources are /open/ if they are distributed
under [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_license][free licenses]]
(such as suitable variants of [[https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/][Creative Commons licenses]]),
guaranteeing [[https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3221][Wiley’s
5Rs of Openness]], namely the rights to
/reuse/, /redistribute/, /revise/, /remix/, and /retain/.
Consequently, OER promise to reduce entry barriers towards
educational resources as well as to avoid redundant work when similar
educational resources of high quality are created in different
organizations.  I explain
