* What is this?
This page collects
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][OER]]
presentations (HTML slides with embedded audio and PDF variants, available under
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_license][free]] and open
[[https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/][Creative Commons licenses]]
in Section [[#presentations]], preceded by usage hints in
Section [[#hints]])
for a course on Operating Systems (following
the book [[https://gustavus.edu/mcs/max/os-book/][Operating Systems and Middleware: Supporting Controlled Interaction]]
by Max Hailperin) as part of the module
[[https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/student-affairs/course-offerings/261893][Computer Structures and Operating Systems]]
for 4th-term students in the Bachelor program in
[[https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/][Information Systems]]
at the [[https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/][University of Münster, Germany]].
Some background concerning the origin of this project and the adopted
teaching and learning strategy
[[https://jittdl.physics.iupui.edu/jitt/][Just-in-Time Teaching]]
(JiTT; see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_in_Time_Teaching][here for the Wikipedia entry]])
is explained in its [[https://gitlab.com/oer/OS/blob/master/README.md][README]].

If you are teaching or learning Operating Systems (OSs), feel free to
use, share, and adapt my presentations.  As usual for projects on GitLab,
you can open [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/create_new_issue.html][issues]]
to report bugs or suggest improvements, ideally
with [[https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html][merge requests]].
The document
[[https://gitlab.com/oer/OS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][CONTRIBUTING]]
contains some pointers for contributors.

Students in Münster have taken courses on programming in Java, data
structures and algorithms, and data modeling before taking “Computer
Structures and Operating Systems.”  As *prerequisite* for Operating
Systems, students should
- be able to write, compile, and execute small /Java/ programs,
- be able to use basic /data structures/ (stack, queue, tree) and
  /algorithms/ (in particular, hashing);
- also, being able to explain the database /transaction concept/ and
  /update anomalies/ will ease understanding of presentations on
  mutual exclusion.

*Learning objectives*: After taking this course, students will be able
- to discuss major architectures and components of modern OSs; to
  explain and contrast processes and threads and their roles for OSs
  and applications,
- to explain OS data structures, algorithms, and management techniques,
- to analyze programming challenges arising from concurrency
  and to apply appropriate techniques addressing these challenges,
- to discuss the notion of IT security and to apply security
  mechanisms provided by the operating system in support of
  secure IT systems.
