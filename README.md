## Abstract
This is the repository for the [Introduction to Computer Science webpage](introcs.maximilian-harl.de). I built this to support the course Introduction to Computer Science at the chair of [Digital Industrial Service Systems](https://www.is.rw.fau.de/) at [FAU](https://www.fau.de/) to move to a more sustainable online format. This was in parts motivated through the COVID-19 crisis but mostly throught the strategy of the course.
The exercises that I created for the course w/ solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/CS_Basics) (only if I already granted you access). The official exercises (most of them with tests) can be found [here](https://github.com/fau-is/IntroCS).

<!---  ## Acknowledgments
I want to thank Sebastian Dunzer for letting me do this as part of IntroCS, as well as Prof. Matzner and Prof. Hart who are responsible for this lecture. Furthermore, I want to thank Dr. Lechtenbörger for creating emacs-reveal for reveal.js and all his OER lectures, which made the infrastructure of this project really convenient. --->
