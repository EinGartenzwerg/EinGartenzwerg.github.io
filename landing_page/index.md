# Hello, world! (TEST AGAIN! 10)
[IntroCS]((https://www.is.rw.fau.de/lehre/veranstaltungen/intro-to-cs/)) is an introductory course for computer science. The course is offered by the institute for information systems at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany and is especcialy tailored for the master degree program in [International Information Systems]((http://iis.fau.de/)) and therein for students who have little or no background in computer science. The course makes use of contents of the chair of digital industrial service systems ([FAU](https://www.fau.de/)), CS50x ([Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/)) and 6.001 ([MIT](http://web.mit.edu/)).
Among this course’s objectives is to supply students with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals and the discipline of computer science. We will do so ny using programming in several different languages as a vehicle to introduce these fundamentals, including such topics as algorithms, abstraction, data, global impact, and internet technologies. Though the course is programming-heavy, it should be emphasized that this is not a “programming course”; rather, this course should be considered one of problem-solving, creativity, and exploration. By the end of the semester, students will have a richer understanding of the key principles of the discipline of computer science. Students will be able to speak intelligently about how computers work and how they enable us to become better problem-solvers, and will hopefully be able to communicate that knowledge to others.

## About this course
Some background concerning the origin of this project and the adopted teaching and learning strategy is explained in its [README](https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/EinGartenzwerg.github.io/blob/master/README.md).

**Learning objectives**: After taking this course, students will be able to
- recognise and deduce patterns among programming problems
- decompose problems into parts and compose solutions thereto
- operate at multiple levels of abstraction
- infer from first principles how computer systems work
- assess correctness, design and style of code
- teach yourself new programming languages
- read code documentation and draw conclusions from specifications
- describe symptoms of problems precisely and ask questions clearly
- test solutions to problems, find faults, and identify corner cases

**How to IntroCS?**:
- Lectures: The main content of this lecture is provided via Lecture Videos, Present Lectures and Guest Talks.
- Shorts: Videos of about 3-30 minutes that dive into a specific topic more deeply.
- Activation Quizzes: Short quizzes that ask about the theoretical concepts from the lecture.
- Exercises/Preliminary Problems: These problems can be used by the students to get a first contact with the content and its application from the lectures/shorts.
- Problem Sets: Problem Sets need to be submitted weekly for grading by the students.

## Academic Honesty
This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.
The essence of all work that students submit to this course must be their own. Collaboration on problems is not permitted except to the extent that students may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing thier work for them. Generally speaking, when asking for help, students may show their code to others, but they may not view their peers', so long as they respect this policy's other constraints.
Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.
