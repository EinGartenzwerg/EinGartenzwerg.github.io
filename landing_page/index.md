# Hello, world!

This is CS50 AP, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.

* What is this?
This page collects
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources][OER]]
presentations (HTML slides with embedded audio and PDF variants, available under
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_license][free]] and open
[[https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/cc-licenses/][Creative Commons licenses]]
in Section [[#presentations]], preceded by usage hints in
Section [[#hints]])
for an indtroductory course on computer science as part of the module
[[https://www.is.rw.fau.de/lehre/veranstaltungen/intro-to-cs/][Introduction to Computer Science]]
for first semester students in the Master degree program in
[[http://iis.fau.de/][International Information Systems]]
at the [[https://www.fau.de/][Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany]].
Some background concerning the origin of this project and the adopted
teaching and learning strategy is explained in its [[https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/EinGartenzwerg.github.io/blob/master/README.md][README]].

If you are teaching or learning computer science, feel free to
use, share, and adapt my presentations.  As usual for projects on GitHub/GitLab,
you can open [[https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue][issues]]
to report bugs or suggest improvements, ideally
with [[https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request][pull requests]].
The document
[[https://github.com/EinGartenzwerg/EinGartenzwerg.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.org][CONTRIBUTING]]
contains some pointers for contributors.

Students in the Master's degree International Information Systems have no prior experience with programming or computer science. Therefore there are no prerequisites for "Introduction to Computer Science".

*Learning objectives*: After taking this course, students will be able to
- recognise and deduce patterns among programming problems
- decompose problems into parts and compose solutions thereto
- operate at multiple levels of abstraction
- infer from first principles how computer systems work
- assess correctness, design and style of code
- teach yourself new programming languages
- read code documentation and draw conclusions from specifications
- describe symptoms of problems precisely and ask questions clearly
- test solutions to problems, find faults, and identify corner cases
